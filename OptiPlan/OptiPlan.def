%files
	## This copies all files in this repository into the container.
	## If you do so, please remove all files not needed to run the planner
	## (e.g. source-code, testing or debugging planning problems) from the container

%setup
	## The "%setup"-part of this script is called to bootstrap an empty
	## container.

%post
	## The "%post"-part of this script is called after the container has
	## been created with the "%setup"-part above and runs "inside the
	## container". Most importantly, it is used to install dependencies
	## and build the planner. Add all commands that have to be executed
	## once before the planner runs in this part of the script.
	
	## Install all necessary dependencies.
